# Genome Mapper

## This Python program takes in a FASTA file containing a nucleotide sequence, runs BlastN via biopython, and maps the location of labs studying the top species associated with the given sequence on an interactive map.

## Prior to running the program, make sure that the following Python libraries are installed on your local machine: Bio, Bio.Blast, progress.bar, pandas, os, re, geopy.geocoders, folium.

## Directions:
## 1. Download the example FASTA file and Python program. 
## 2. Run the Python program with the FASTA file as the input to run BlastN. (FASTA files containing any sequence can be used with this program, but the example file will provide an example of the expected output.)
## 3. The program will produce an HTML file containing the interactive map.
